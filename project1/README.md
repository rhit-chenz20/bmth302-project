# Instruction on how to use
In the main.py file, there is a adjacency matrix that could be modified.
The last two lines of code are the ones you want to comment/uncomment depending the goal you want to atrive.

   assemble_reads: Given the adjacency matrix, a possible ordering of the vertices will be printed that can be assembled to a genome.
   
   plot_transitive_orientation: Given the adjacency matrix, plot one possible transitive orientation of the graph.
   
After modifying main.py, you can run it directly from terminal or your editor of choice.
